## üéØ The Problem

Exoplanet detection is one of the most exciting frontiers in modern astronomy, but it faces several challenges:

1. **Data Complexity**: Light curve data from missions like Kepler and TESS contains millions of data points that require sophisticated analysis
2. **Signal Detection**: Identifying the subtle periodic dips in stellar brightness caused by transiting exoplanets requires advanced algorithms
3. **Accessibility**: Professional exoplanet detection tools are often complex and inaccessible to students, educators, and citizen scientists
4. **Visualization**: Understanding the scale and characteristics of exoplanetary systems is difficult without proper 3D visualization tools
5. **Data Integration**: NASA's exoplanet archive contains over 5,600 confirmed exoplanets, but accessing and exploring this data can be challenging
